Course deliverable for ITSC 3155 Assignment 2. A modular program intended to represent a sandwich maker.
  "First, users select the size of the sandwich, then the machine determines how much resources are
   available before making it. The user receives a message if there are insufficient resources. 
   Otherwise, the user must pay for sandwich by coins. The machine will indicate if insufficient 
   coins are inserted or if there is an exchange amount when coins are inserted. Also, on the 
   screen, users can view the remaining resources report and turn off the machine."
